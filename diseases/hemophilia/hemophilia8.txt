Symptoms of hemophilia range from increased bleeding after trauma, injury, or surgery to sudden bleeding with no apparent cause. There are two types of hemophilia:
Hemophilia A -- also called classic hemophilia -- is most common and occurs in about 80% of people with hemophilia.
Hemophilia B -- also called Christmas disease -- is less common and occurs in about 20% of people with hemophilia.
