Joint deformity: People with severe hemophilia may suffer spontaneous bleeding in the joints. People with less severe hemophilia may have bleeding in a joint if they fall or are injured. If joint bleeds are not promptly and adequately treated, joint deformity can occur. Bleeding in a joint can cause scarring in the joint. With repeated bleeds, the joint may lose mobility and result in a permanent limp. The knee, ankle, and elbow joints are most commonly affected. Bleeding into the muscles of the legs can also be severely disabling.
Blood in urine: Blood in the urine may occur on occasion, due to bleeding from the kidneys or bladder. If the bleeding is heavy, you can get blood clots that obstruct urine flow.
Problems breathing: Breathing problems can occur as a result of bleeding into the throat, nose bleeds, coughing or vomiting. If not promptly treated, bleeding in the throat can interfere with breathing so much that a patient may need to be put onto a ventilator until the bleeding stops and swelling goes down.
Brain damage: Bleeding in the brain may cause permanent brain damage and disability or even death. While usually caused by trauma, in very severe cases of hemophilia, these areas may bleed without known injury.
