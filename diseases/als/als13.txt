When symptoms begin in the arms or legs, it is referred to as "limb onset" ALS.  Other individuals first notice speech or swallowing problems, termed "bulbar onset" ALS.
Regardless of where the symptoms first appear, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Individuals may develop problems with moving, swallowing (dysphagia), speaking or forming words (dysarthria), and breathing (dyspnea).
