There are several potential risk factors for ALS including:
Age. Although the disease can strike at any age, symptoms most commonly develop between the ages of 55 and 75.
Gender. Men are slightly more likely than women to develop ALS. However, as we age the difference between men and women disappears.
Race and ethnicity. Most likely to develop the disease are Caucasians and non-Hispanics.
Some studies suggest that military veterans are about 1.5 to 2 times more likely to develop ALS. Although the reason for this is unclear, possible risk factors for veterans include exposure to lead, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. ALS is recognized as a service-connected disease by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
